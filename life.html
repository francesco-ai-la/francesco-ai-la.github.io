    <h1>Life</h1>

    <p>
      I am still trying to understand the ideal interconnectedness between work and life.
      I accept and reject all the theories I have encountered so far:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        the Silicon Valley dismissal of conventional work-life balance in favor of total
        commitment to building your business
      </li>
      <li>
        the Jeff Bezos work-life harmony
      </li>
      <li>
        the other various hybrid options
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So far I embrace the traditional view of my Italian culture: work and life should be
      clearly separated. Maybe that's why I haven't "made it big" (whatever that means)
      in my professional California-based tech career.
    </p>
