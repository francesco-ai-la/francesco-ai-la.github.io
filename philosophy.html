    <h1>Philosophy</h1>

    <p>
      One of my closest friends is from Saudi Arabia, and I try to visit him every year.
      In 2023, during one of my trips there, I met one of his friends with whom I connected
      very deeply. After speaking with him for a while, I asked what he does in life, and
      he told me he is a poet.
    </p>

    <p>
      That answer struck me. I know people still write poems nowadays, but I had always
      associated the profession of a poet with those who wrote centuries ago—figures I
      encountered during literature classes. His confidence in asserting his profession
      through the art he creates was a powerful epiphany for me, as it made me realize the
      many limitations that Western society imposes today when starting a professional
      career.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think that one day, forty years from now, I will be a philosopher. However, I do
      not want to identify this as my current profession. I want to be someone who earns
      the right to philosophize through whatever I am able to contribute during my tiny
      existence in this vast world. Unlike my poet friend—and other friends I have in
      music, cinema, and other artistic endeavors—I do not believe I have a talent that
      is worth showing to the world today, apart from the few words on this website that
      may inspire somebody.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my true form of artistry lies in living an interesting life.
