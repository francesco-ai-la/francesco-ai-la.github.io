    <h1>Work</h1>

    <p>
      I am currently employed at Accenture, in the Data & AI Strategy group,
      for their Los Angeles office.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever people describe me as "working in consulting" they are wrong.
      Accenture does a lot of things, and as much as I want to dislike the association
      of my profession to consulting (not because there is something inherently evil
      in consulting, I just enjoy the notion of taking on responsibility); I sincerely
      enjoy working for them, since I am sometimes surrounded by very talented people,
      and I get to work on exciting projects for really cool and impactful clients.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work in deploying AI solutions. My official title in my last two projects
      is "quality engineering lead", but having no engineering background and respecting
      immensely real engineers, I am by no means an engineer, yet someone that really
      enjoys working with them. Usually, real synergies are created by my collaboration
      with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      While deploying new technologies, such in the case of AI in the current era,
      there are a lot of novel issues. I find them, I try to solve them, and I work
      in communicating to clients and internal teams what is happening while pushing
      things forward.
    </p>
