    <h1>On my title</h1>

    <p>
      I am currently employed at Accenture, in the Data &amp; AI Strategy group, for their Los Angeles office.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever people describe me as "working in consulting" they are wrong. Accenture does a lot of things, and as much as I want to dislike the association of my profession to consulting (not because there is something inherently evil in consulting, I just enjoy the notion of taking on responsibility); I sincerely enjoy working for them, since I am sometimes surrounded by very talented people, and I get to work on exciting projects for really cool and impactful clients.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work in deploying AI solutions. My official title in my last two projects is "quality engineering lead", but having no engineering background and respecting immensely real engineers, I am by no means an engineer, yet someone that really enjoys working with them. Usually, real synergies are created by my collaboration with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      While deploying new technologies, such in the case of AI in the current era, there are a lot of novel issues. I find them, I try to solve them, and I work in communicating to clients and internal teams what is happening while pushing things forward.
